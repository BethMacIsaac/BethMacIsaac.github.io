            <h2>Electron Application</h2>
        </div>



        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>For a self-directed project, I decided to learn Electron, a JavaScript framework that allows you to write cross-platform
            desktop applications with JS, CSS and HTML.</p>

        <p>Electron combines Node.JS with a Chromium browser, providing front-end and back-end infrastructure that Electron seamlessly
        integrates with each other. The result is backend code, written with Node that can directly pass changes to the front-end, including
            information directly from the PCâ€™s file system.</p>

        <p>I enjoyed working with electron, because it felt like a culmination of my knowledge of JavaScript. My first exposure
            to JS was writing console applications with Node, then I learned how to manipulate and design using the browser DOM, and
            then once I had the basics down I learned how to use frameworks and write a full-stack web application with Node and Express.
            Being able to then take all that knowledge and write a desktop app felt like a logical next step.</p>

        <h3>Demo</h3>
        <img id="gifExample" src="../pics/electron.gif">

        <p>To gain knowledge of the framework I built a couple small applications to see how it works, the most complete apps were an
            application that displays metadata for files on my computer (shown in the demo), and a to-do list app.</p>


        <p>The app examples I have included were styled with CSS using flexbox and use simple html elements to create an interface
            with windows that can talk between themselves and to the host computer.</p>

        <p>I am working on something bigger with this to build on my <a href="../dnd/home.html">mobile-friendly D&D app</a> - so stay tuned!</p>
